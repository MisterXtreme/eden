Torch mod - formerly mod "Torches"

This mod changes the default torch drawtype from "torchlike" to "mesh",
giving the torch a three dimensional appearance. The mesh contains the
proper pixel mapping to make the animation appear as a particle above
the torch, while in fact the animation is just the texture of the mesh.

The "torch" mod (as mentioned above) has been modified by octacian for use
in Eden.
