Eden mod: trees
===============

The trees mod provides an API and registers trees to be generated across the world. It also implements a chatcommand, `/place_tree <name> <pos>` (`name`: itemstring-like name of tree structure, `pos`: position to place tree at - defaults to current player position). The chatcommand requires the `debug` privilege.
