# This file contains all settings displayed in the settings menu under Games -> Eden.
#
# General format:
#    name (Readable name) type type_args
#
# Note that the parts are separated by exactly one space
#
# `type` can be:
#    - int
#    - string
#    - bool
#    - float
#    - enum
#    - path
#    - filepath
#    - key (will be ignored in GUI, since a special key change dialog exists)
#    - flags
#    - noise_params
#
# `type_args` can be:
#   * int:
#            - default
#            - default min max
#   * string:
#            - default (if default is not specified then "" is set)
#   * bool:
#            - default
#   * float:
#            - default
#            - default min max
#   * enum:
#            - default value1,value2,...
#   * path:
#            - default (if default is not specified then "" is set)
#   * filepath:
#            - default (if default is not specified then "" is set)
#   * key:
#            - default
#   * flags:
#            Flags are always separated by comma without spaces.
#            - default possible_flags
#   * noise_params:
#            TODO: these are currently treated like strings
#
# Comments directly above a setting are bound to this setting.
# All other comments are ignored.
#
# Comments and (Readable name) are handled by gettext.
# Comments should be complete sentences that describe the setting and possibly
#  give the user additional useful insight.
# Sections are marked by a single line in the format: [Section Name]
# Sub-section are marked by adding * in front of the section name: [*Sub-section]
# Sub-sub-sections have two * etc.
# There shouldn't be too much settings per category; settings that shouldn't be
#  modified by the "average user" should be in (sub-)categories called "Advanced".

#    If this is disabled, particles are not shown above torches.
eden_torch_particles (Torch Particles) bool true

[Mapgen]

#    If this is enabled, the top textures of some nodes will be rotated
#    as the map generates and when the node is placed for increased variety.
#    Only nodes in the `rotate.lua` `nodes` table are effected.
mapgen_rotate_textures (Mapgen: Randomly rotate textures) bool false

[Player Physics]

#    Primary key that triggers a sprint speed multiplier when held.
#    This defaults to aux1, which is also used if fast_move is enabled.
sprint_primary (Primary Sprint Key) string aux1

#    Secondary key that triggers the speed and jump multipliers when double-pressed
#    and held for the duration. This is most convenient to map to the "up" ("forward")
#    key, as it allows seemlessly enabling sprint by simply double-tapping forward
#    without having to move your hand to reach another key.
sprint_second (Secondary Sprint Key) string up

#    If disabled, the secondary sprint key (sprint_second) is not allowed.
sprint_enable_second (Double-tap Secondary Key to Sprint) bool true

#    Speed multiplier applied when sprinting.
#    Sprint key configured with the sprint_primary setting.
sprint_speed (Speed Multiplier) float 1.5

#    If enabled, particles are shown behind the player when sprinting, taking on
#    the top texture of the node that the player is walking on.
sprint_particles (Enable Particles While Sprinting) bool false

#    Configures the number of particles to be added behind the player as they
#    sprint. A greater number gives more variety but causes more load on the server.
sprint_particle_num (Max Number of Particles to Spawn) int 1 0 10
