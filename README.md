Eden is a Role playing game like sandbox subgame for the popular FOSS 
Engine "Minetest"
, while based on it, this is not to be confused with "minetest_game".

Eden allows you to play in a free-and-open world styled role-playing 
game, unlike most "RPGs", Eden aims to have yo create your OWN identity, 
and also allows you to explore a giant, randomly-generated world, filled 
with many "NPCs", animals, treasures, and many other things, feel free 
to mine, quest, build, or whatever tickles your fancy, there is no 
right, or wrong way to play, so just have fun! :D
